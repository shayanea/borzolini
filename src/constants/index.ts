export const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    id: "accuracy",
    question: "How accurate is the AI in predicting health issues?",
    answer: "Our AI has achieved 98% accuracy in early detection of common pet health conditions. It's trained on over 100,000 pet health records and continuously learns from veterinary outcomes. However, AI recommendations should always be confirmed with a licensed veterinarian."
  },
  {
    id: "replacement",
    question: "Is this a replacement for veterinary care?",
    answer: "No, our AI is designed to enhance, not replace, veterinary care. We help you detect issues early and connect you with qualified veterinarians for proper diagnosis and treatment. Think of it as having a health-conscious friend watching over your pet 24/7."
  },
  {
    id: "breeds",
    question: "What breeds does the AI specialize in?",
    answer: "We're starting with Persian cats (like Fariborz!) and expanding to other breeds. Our AI has specialized knowledge of breed-specific health patterns, genetic predispositions, and optimal care routines. We'll be adding more breeds based on user demand."
  },
  {
    id: "savings",
    question: "How much can I really save with preventive care?",
    answer: "Our users save an average of $2,400 annually through early detection and prevention. For example, catching kidney disease early costs $200-500 for treatment, while advanced kidney disease can cost $3,000-8,000. Prevention is always more affordable than treatment."
  },
  {
    id: "privacy",
    question: "Is my pet's data secure and private?",
    answer: "Yes, we take privacy seriously. All pet health data is encrypted and stored securely. We never share individual pet information without your explicit consent. We may use anonymized, aggregated data to improve our AI models and contribute to veterinary research."
