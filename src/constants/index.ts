    question: 'How accurate is the AI in predicting health issues?',
    answer:
      "Our AI has achieved 98% accuracy in early detection of common pet health conditions. It's trained on over 100,000 pet health records and continuously learns from veterinary outcomes. However, AI recommendations should always be confirmed with a licensed veterinarian.",

    question: 'What breeds does the AI specialize in?',
    answer:

    question: 'How much can I really save with preventive care?',

      'Our users save an average of $2,400 annually through early detection and prevention. For example, catching kidney disease early costs $200-500 for treatment, while advanced kidney disease can cost $3,000-8,000. Prevention is always more affordable than treatment.',
